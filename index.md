## Mathematical & Statistical Topics

[Here are a few Jupyter Notebooks](jupyter_notebooks.md) that I've written on various topics in mathematical and statistical computing:

* Bayesian Beta-Binomial Example -- An example of Bayesian parameter estimation
* Covid-19 and Blood Types (using a Bayesian approach) -- An alternative approach to a 2020 paper in medRxiv
* Extreme Value Theory (EVT) Example -- EVT is used to analyze rare events
* Monoids 101 for Apache Spark -- Tutorial on large scale, distributed computing

Python APIs (experimental):
* Qualitative Reasoning:  Spatio-Temporal Reasoning using Relation Algebras and Constraint Networks. [github](https://github.com/alreich/qualreas)
* Abstract Algebra - Finite Algebras in Python (Groups, Rings, Fields, Vector Spaces, Modules, Monoids, Semigroups, and Magmas) [documentation](https://abstract-algebra.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) and [source code](https://github.com/alreich/abstract_algebra)
