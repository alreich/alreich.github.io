# Bio

Iâ€™m a retired mathematician. My area of specialty is Mathematical Statistics. I worked in industry for my entire career in the area of scientific computing, including:
* Spacecraft Navigation (1980-87, Space Shuttle)
* Artificial Intelligence (1987-1995, Automated Planning)
* Computational Geometry (1995-2007)
* Electronic Design Automation), Machine Learning, and Data Science (2007-2017, Cyber Security)
Most of my work has involved computer programming that, over my decades-long career, has involved about a dozen different programming languages.
