# Brief Professional Bio

Iâ€™m a retired mathematician. My area of specialty is Mathematical Statistics. I worked in industry for my entire career in the area of scientific computing, including:
* Spacecraft Navigation 1980-87 (e.g., Space Shuttle Onboard & Ground Navigation)
* Artificial Intelligence 1987-1995 (e.g., Automated Planning, Spatio-Temporal Reasoning)
* Semiconductor Manufacturing 1995-2007 (e.g., Optical Proximity Correction, Design for Manufacturing)
* National Defense (2007-2017) (e.g., Data Science, Machine Learning, Cyber-Security)

## Skills

Over the course of my career, my work involved many different technologies and application domains.  And much of my work involved programming in many different programming languages.  [These are some of the technologies, domains, and programming languages I'm familiar with.](skills.md)

## Publications & Patents

A list of my papers and patents can be found at [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=N_wnSyUAAAAJ&hl=en).
(Here's a [PDF version](Google_Scholar_AJR.pdf), in case the link doesn't work.)

## Mathematical & Statistical Topics

[Here are a few Jupyter Notebooks](jupyter_notebooks.md) that I've written on various topics in mathematical and statistical computing:

* Bayesian Beta-Binomial Example -- An example of Bayesian parameter estimation
* Covid-19 and Blood Types (using a Bayesian approach) -- An alternative approach to a recent paper
* Extreme Value Theory (EVT) Example -- EVT is used to analyze rare events
* Monoids 101 for Apache Spark -- Tutorial on large scale, distributed computing

## Hobbies

I'm an avid photographer. Many of my photos can be seen at [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/alreich).

I'm also love to draw and paint. Some of my recent work can be found on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/al.reich/)
