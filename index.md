## Mathematical & Statistical Topics

[Here are a few Jupyter Notebooks](jupyter_notebooks.md) that I've written on various topics in mathematical and statistical computing:

* Bayesian Beta-Binomial Example -- An example of Bayesian parameter estimation
* Covid-19 and Blood Types (using a Bayesian approach) -- An alternative approach to a recent paper
* Extreme Value Theory (EVT) Example -- EVT is used to analyze rare events
* Monoids 101 for Apache Spark -- Tutorial on large scale, distributed computing
