# Brief Professional Bio

Iâ€™m a retired mathematician. My area of specialty is Mathematical Statistics. I worked in industry for my entire career in the area of scientific computing, including:
* Spacecraft Navigation 1980-87 (e.g., Space Shuttle Onboard & Ground Navigation)
* Artificial Intelligence 1987-1995 (e.g., Automated Planning, Spatio-Temporal Reasoning)
* Semiconductor Manufacturing 1995-2007 (e.g., Optical Proximity Correction, Design for Manufacturing)
* National Defense (2007-2017) (e.g., Data Science, Machine Learning, Cyber-Security)

![My Job History in Images](images/job_history_images.png)

Most of my work has involved computer programming that, over my decades-long career, has involved over a dozen different programming languages, including Python, R, Apache Spark, Java, Matlab, SQL, Scheme, Common Lisp, Prolog, C++, C, and Fortran.

## My Publications & Patents

A list of my papers and patents can be found at [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=N_wnSyUAAAAJ&hl=en).  (Here's a [PDF version](Google_Scholar_AJR.pdf), in case the link doesn't work.)

## Mathematical & Statistical Topics

[This link](jupyter_notebooks.md) will take you to a few Jupyter Notebooks that I've written on various topics in mathematical and statistical computing:

* Bayesian Beta-Binomial Example -- An example of Bayesian parameter estimation
* Covid-19 and Blood Types (using a Bayesian approach) -- An alternative approach to a recent paper
* Extreme Value Theory (EVT) Example -- EVT is used to analyze rare events
* Monoids 101 for Apache Spark -- Tutorial on large scale, distributed computing

### Bayesian Data Analysis Resources

* [Books & Python Libraries](bayes.md)
* [Bayesian Inference in R](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Bayesian.html)

## My Hobbies

I'm an avid photographer. Many of my photos can be seen at [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/alreich).

I'm also love to draw and paint. Some of my recent works can be found on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/al.reich/)
