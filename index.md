# Statistical Topics

The following provide links to Jupyter notebooks on various topics in statistical analysis, machine learning, and data science:

## Extreme Value Theory (EVT)

This Jupyter notebook describes EVT calculations using an example from Stuart Cole's book, "An Introduction to Statistical Modeling of Extreme Values". The calculations are done using both Python and R. It is noted that there does not appear to be a standard representation of the GEV distribution. Representations differ on how the shape parameter, ξ, should be expressed. Specifically, the shape parameter in the 'ismev' package in R is the negative of the shape parameter in the Python 'scipy.stats.genextreme' module.

# Bio

I’m a retired mathematician. My area of specialty is Mathematical Statistics. I worked in industry for my entire career in the area of scientific computing, including:
* Spacecraft Navigation 1980-87 (e.g., Space Shuttle onboard & ground navigation)
* Artificial Intelligence 1987-1995 (e.g., Automated Planning, Temporal Reasoning)
* Semiconductor Manufacturing 1995-2007 (e.g., Optical Proximity Correction, Design for Manufacturing)
* National Defense (2007-2017) (e.g., Data Science, Machine Learning, Cyber Security)

Most of my work has involved computer programming that, over my decades-long career, has involved about a dozen different programming languages.
